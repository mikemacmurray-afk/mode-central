Here are the files you need for your Mode Central app deployment:

---

### src/ModeCentral.jsx
Paste your full Mode Central component code here (the single-file React component you already have from the canvas). Ensure it includes all the UI, state management, and localStorage logic.

Example placeholder start:
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function ModeCentral() {
  // Your full Mode Central component code here
}
```

---

### src/App.jsx
Replace the default Vite App.jsx with this:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ModeCentral from './ModeCentral';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-50 p-6">
      <ModeCentral />
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### Notes
1. Make sure `ModeCentral.jsx` is located in the `src/` folder.
2. Test locally with:
```cmd
npm run dev
```
3. Commit and push changes to GitHub, then redeploy on Netlify.
4. After redeploy, your URL `https://modecentral.netlify.app/` should now show the proper Mode Central app.
